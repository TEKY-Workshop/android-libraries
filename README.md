Instead of changing the header text, we will load a random image into an imageview using Picasso.

* Add [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) via Gradle
* Add an image view to your view and create a reference to it with Butterknife
* Change the onClick listener for the button to load the image with picasso. See the github page for picasso to determine how to use it.
